    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01/10/2024</p>

    <p>This privacy policy outlines how we manages user data in our application, "Azan Times".</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal data or personally identifiable information (such as name, email, or location) through the app.</p>
    
    <h2>User-Provided Data</h2>
    <p>The app allows users to manually enter their city to retrieve prayer times. This data is not stored or transmitted to any external servers and is only used locally within the app to provide the prayer times feature.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses third-party services for retrieving prayer times and city information based on the userâ€™s input. These services include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aladhan API:</strong> Used to retrieve accurate prayer times for the city entered by the user.</li>
        <li><strong>GeoNames API:</strong> Used to help find city information based on user input.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services only use the city information provided by the user and do not collect any personal data.</p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>The app does not contain any advertisements.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Although the app does not process personal data, we take precautions to ensure that any data (like city names) entered by users is handled securely within the app. No user information is transmitted to or stored on external servers.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated effective date.</p>
