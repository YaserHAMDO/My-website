        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the "On Duty Pharmacy" mobile application. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We value your privacy. The "On Duty Pharmacy" app does not collect, store, or share any personal information from our users. The app allows users to find pharmacies based on their location or by selecting a city and district.</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">Location Data:</span> Although the app uses your location to provide nearby pharmacy information, we do not store or collect any personal data related to your location. The location data is only used temporarily to find pharmacies in your vicinity and is not retained after the session ends.</p>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The "On Duty Pharmacy" app requests access to the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Location Permission:</span> This is used to detect your current location to show pharmacies near you. You can also search pharmacies by selecting a city and district without granting location access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We do not share any user data with third parties. However, the app may integrate with third-party services like ads or analytics, which may collect anonymous data related to app usage for improving the app experience.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, since we do not collect personal information, the risk of exposing your data is minimal.</p>
